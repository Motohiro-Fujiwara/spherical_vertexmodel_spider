# spherical surface vertex model for shaping spider embryo
The file "germband_C_open.cpp" is vertex model code for shaping spider embryo.  
This spherical surface vertex model code was written in C++.  
Operation checks were made using operating systems for Mac and Linux.  
Please use the data files in the "initial_setting_cell1840" folder in the "Examples" folder as the initial state to calculate the spider embryo simulation.  
More information about the equations in the program code is described in https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fcell.2022.932814/full.
